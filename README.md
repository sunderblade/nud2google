# nud2google
So this is a rough cludge of a few files designed to convert a old Now-Up-To-Date export to text (Tabbed separated) that has been opened by Excel and converted to a comma seperated text file (.CSV) to eventually be converted to a compatible file that can be imported into Google calendar. This was project specific, so some of the values have been hard coded.  

Note: Make sure you remove/replace all commas from the tabbed separated document.

I am currently using bash and a whisper of python 2.7 on a Mac.  Bash is kind of rough so eventually I would recode it all in python once I learn it better. I just found somethings easier to cope with in bash so I went with it.

The central script file is nud2goog.sh.
